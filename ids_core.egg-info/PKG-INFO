# IDS Core - Network Intrusion Detection System

A Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that uses machine learning to detect malicious network traffic.

## Overview
`ids_core` is a Python-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor network traffic for malicious activities. The system captures IP packets, analyzes them, and logs the results, providing real-time notifications when malicious packets are detected.

## Features
- Real-time packet capture and analysis
- Machine learning-based threat detection
- Automated email alerts when malicious packets are detected
- Detailed logging of network activity
- Command-line interface for easy deployment

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Linux operating system
- Root privileges (for packet sniffing)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install ids-core
```

## Usage
To start the IDS, run the following command:
```
ids-core
```

## Structure
The project consists of the following main components:
- **main.py**: Entry point for the application.
- **packet_sniffer.py**: Captures network packets.
- **packet_analyzer.py**: Analyzes captured packets and classifies them.
- **notifications/email_notifier.py**: Handles email notifications for malicious packets.
- **utils/logger.py**: Provides logging functionality.
